 # About Me

I currently work at Fishing Cactus as a freelance game developer, focusing on Unreal Engine 5. My main responsibilities involve developing open-world AI interactions, bringing immersive and dynamic experiences to life within the game environment.
I have a deep passion for videogames, always eager to discover the latest releases in the industry. I find them to be a remarkable form of art and storytelling that can transport us to different worlds and evoke emotions. Exploring the intersections of technology and gaming is an area that truly excites me.

## Projects I'm Proud of

I'm delighted to share some of my favorite projects that I've worked on:

<details>
 <summary>SCOP</summary>

 ### Project description
[SCOP](https://github.com/DimiOui/42-PCC-SCOP) is a project that explores basic GPU rendering through Vulkan, rendering a textured model within a GLFW window using C++. The model, sourced from an OBJ file and textured from a BMP file, rotates continuously around its central axis. Users can zoom in/out on the model, move around it and change the shaders on the run.

### Skills acquired
- GPU Rendering Knowledge
- Graphics Programming
- 3D loading and rendering
- Texture loading and mapping
- Vertex Processing
- Shader compilation

 <summary>FT_TRANSCENDANCE</summary>
 
### Project description
[Ft_transcendance](https://github.com/misteriaud/ft_transcendence) is a Docker-compose deployable webgame that features social-networking mechanisms such as friendships, direct-messages, and profile pictures. It includes a real-time multiplayer version of the classic game Pong and a chatroom with administration roles. The project also implements authentication using OAuth2 (through the 42school provider) and a 2FA-TOTP implementation. It is built on top of NestJS as the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, and ReactJS/Tailwind as the frontend.

### Skills acquired
- REST API concepts.
- Websockets.
- Multiplayer network gaming concepts (prediction, latency management, ...)
- Interface between NestJS Object-oriented data-structure and PostgreSQL relational database via Prisma.
- Authentication and authorization standards (OAuth2, JWT, Password hashing, TOTP).

 <summary>CUBE3D</summary>
 
### Project Description
[Cube3d](https://github.com/DimiOui/42-Cub3D) is a simple raycasting game engine inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D. It utilizes the concept of raycasting to render a 3D graphical representation of a maze-like environment.

### Skills acquired
- Raycasting / Graphics programming
- 2D Game engine development
- Window and event management
- Map parsing and validation
- Collision detection
- Optimization techniques
- Understanding of linear algebra
