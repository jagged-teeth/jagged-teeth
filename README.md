### :bulb: Curiosity is My Driving Force
I believe that curiosity is the key to continuous growth and personal development. Throughout my life, I've been fortunate to embark on various adventures that have shaped my perspective.
I grew up in Arizona, surrounded by deserts, cacti, and American culture. The vivid memories of that period are etched in my mind. The scorching heat of Phoenix carries a distinct scent that is incomparable to the lush humidity of France, where I returned in 1996.
Inspired by movies like **Matrix** and **Ghost In the Shell**, video-games such as **MYST**, **Outer Wilds**, **Conker : A Bad Fur Day** or **Silent Hill**, and animes like **Serial Experiment Lain**, I developed a deep passion for science-fiction, fantasy and the realms of imagination.
As I delved into passionate readings of novels from various countries, and embraced the open-mindedness instilled in me by my family, I also explored niche music genres, which I practice today on my computer.

### :hammer_and_wrench: From Welding to Programming

My journey has been anything but linear. I've worn multiple hats throughout my life, including working as a welder, boilermaker and industrial designer. These diverse experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a remarkable ability to adapt to new challenges. Transitioning from the physical realm to the world of programming was a significant turning point in my life. It required a shift in perspective and the mastery of a new set of tools. However, my innate curiosity and adaptability served me well in this transition.

### :video_game: Passion for Videogames and experience

I currently work at Fishing Cactus as a game developer, focusing on Unreal Engine 5.4. My main responsibilities involve developing open-world AI interactions, bringing immersive and dynamic experiences to life within the game environment. This role allows me to merge my passion for videogames with my technical expertise, contributing to innovative projects in the gaming industry.
I have a deep passion for videogames, always eager to discover the latest releases in the industry (recently Balatro, Helldivers 2 or Baldur's Gate III). I find them to be a remarkable form of art and storytelling that can transport us to different worlds and evoke emotions. Exploring the intersections of technology and gaming is an area that truly excites me.

## Projects I'm Proud of

I'm delighted to share some of my favorite projects that I've worked on:

<details>
 <summary>SCOP</summary>

 ### Project description
[SCOP](https://github.com/DimiOui/42-PCC-SCOP) is a project that explores basic GPU rendering through Vulkan, rendering a textured model within a GLFW window using C++. The model, sourced from an OBJ file and textured from a BMP file, rotates continuously around its central axis. Users can zoom in/out on the model, move around it and change the shaders on the run.

### Skills acquired
- GPU Rendering Knowledge
- Graphics Programming
- 3D loading and rendering
- Texture loading and mapping
- Vertex Processing
- Shader compilation

 <summary>FT_TRANSCENDANCE</summary>
 
### Project description
[Ft_transcendance](https://github.com/misteriaud/ft_transcendence) is a Docker-compose deployable webgame that features social-networking mechanisms such as friendships, direct-messages, and profile pictures. It includes a real-time multiplayer version of the classic game Pong and a chatroom with administration roles. The project also implements authentication using OAuth2 (through the 42school provider) and a 2FA-TOTP implementation. It is built on top of NestJS as the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, and ReactJS/Tailwind as the frontend.

### Skills acquired
- REST API concepts.
- Websockets.
- Multiplayer network gaming concepts (prediction, latency management, ...)
- Interface between NestJS Object-oriented data-structure and PostgreSQL relational database via Prisma.
- Authentication and authorization standards (OAuth2, JWT, Password hashing, TOTP).

 <summary>CUBE3D</summary>
 
### Project Description
[Cube3d](https://github.com/DimiOui/42-Cub3D) is a simple raycasting game engine inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D. It utilizes the concept of raycasting to render a 3D graphical representation of a maze-like environment.

### Skills acquired
- Raycasting / Graphics programming
- 2D Game engine development
- Window and event management
- Map parsing and validation
- Collision detection
- Optimization techniques
- Understanding of linear algebra
